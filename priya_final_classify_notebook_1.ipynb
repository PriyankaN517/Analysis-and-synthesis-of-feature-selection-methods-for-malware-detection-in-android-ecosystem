    "## Problem Statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since android’s existence in the market, it has become one of the emerging trends and popular open source operating system in the smartphone market with its outstanding features. For browsing internet, online banking, and social networking, smartphones are being used in the present era. Along with these, used for available mobile functions like SMS messaging, real-time location sharing, etc. With the increasing capabilities of functionality of android phones, these are attracting people in a wider range. It seems that around 2019, out of 100 smartphones sold, 86.6 are android devices. And by 2020 April, we can find more than 2.8 million applications in google play store. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the rapid development of android phones, a major change in people’s way of leading lives have been observed. Such as various aspects in everyday life like conducting social communication, making business, etc. A rich variety in mobile applications can be exhibited not only in daily routine but also for people with particular needs. Different markets like Google’s play store, Microsoft’s windows store, etc. offer a variety of applications ranging from games, navigation systems, multimedia applications and even applications that are related to health. And smartphone market is growing not only with provided applications but also with downloads made by users. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The increase in the popularity of smart phones is directly proportional to the malware activities that are taking place. This development led user not in a state of detecting any malicious activity which happens in their own device. This malware infringes user’s privacy by compromising data integrity, destroying sensitive information. Once, these malware applications are implanted into smart devices, all system information will be exposed to attackers and results in memory corruption, device buffering, redirect to vulnerable by cross site scripting and then steals user’s credentials. However, with rapid widespread of malware activities in android systems, it is impossible to detect these activities manually. Hence, automated techniques are being welcomed to effectively detect them. And machine learning algorithms are playing a crucial role. These algorithms solely depend on extracting features from original applications. But these extracted features size is large and moreover raw which contains duplicate and redundant data. This type of data may mislead results. Finally, feature selection methods came into force which selects features subset from original dataset by performing different methods. Hence, in this paper we aim to compare performance of different filter-based methods. Different feature selection methods were analyzed by finding out the way which was employed to select features subset, similarities between different employed selection methods by comparing their performance and also with respect to scoring function, influence of subset size on the methods, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim of this research is to compare different filter-based feature selection methods to detect malware in android ecosystem. To detect malware in android systems we found machine learning as one of the most effective techniques as it is highly influenced by quality and relevant features, feature selection has become one of the promising techniques in machine learning. Hence, we need datasets to extract features and these datasets are collected from a trusted source AndroZoo site. And to check whether the collected datasets are benign or malware, we use VirusTotal premium API. After testing them, we separate malware apps and benign apps and collect some features using two feature selection methods algorithms namely Filter based. Then we predict the accuracy of selection algorithms using some classification algorithms like SVM, KNN, Naivebayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, we have gathered datasets from AndroZoo site. To get dataset from site, we need permission from both AndroZoo and supervisor. After giving permission, they gave an API key. And to download dataset we need Sha256 value along with API key. Then, downloaded a CSV file from website and read the data in it by using Python programming language. Hence, Sha256 value was collected and using both API key and Sha256 value, we have downloaded 2250 APK files from browser. Then loaded these APK files in Google Colab and used AndroGuard library to extract app features dataframe. Along with this, to check whether all our 2250 APKs are benign or malware, requested VirusTotal for premium API and tested APKs automatically using premium API. Here, all the positives are noted in excel sheet along with other APKs information and mean value was found for the positives column and got threshold ‘4’. A threshold value is the one where number of security vendors in VirusTotal declare an application as malware. After testing apks in VirusTotal, separated benign and malware apps. Then, unpacked some APK files and extracted permissions into a list and used dictionary to read multiple APKs permissions at a time and formed a feature vector with 1’s and 0’s. Following this, feature vector sheet is converted into .arrf file and loaded into Weka tool to form feature subsets for filter-based methods, but unfortunately didn't get proper results when weka was used. Hence, used mlxtend and sklearn libraries in python and to form feature subsets. Hence, feature subsets were formed using both filter-based methods."
