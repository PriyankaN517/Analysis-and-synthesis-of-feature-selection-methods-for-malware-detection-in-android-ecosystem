# Analysis-and-synthesis-of-feature-selection-methods-for-malware-detection-in-android-ecosystem
To create dataset which contains benign and malware apks permissions, collected API key from AndrooZoo website and downloaded 2250 apks. 
Then, used virustotal tool to test whether these apks are benign or malware and seperated both these types of apks by setting threshold value which is average of total positives.
Hence, loaded these benign and malware apks zip folders seperately and unpacked XML files from apks using AndroGuard library available in python. 
Finally a feature vector sheet is formed with a list of unique features of both benign and malware apks. This feature vector sheet will be in binary format.
Then used feature selection methods to filter top features requested by apks and to compare which feature selection method is performing best, used some classification algorithms.
